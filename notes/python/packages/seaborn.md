## What's the difference between `seaborn` and `matplotlib`?

> Seaborn is designed to be more user-friendly and to work better with `pandas` dataframes. For more information on dataframes and the `pandas` package see [here] (https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/notes/python/packages/pandas.md). It is also easier to customize plot colors, formats, etc. with Seaborn.

Before diving into seaborn, make sure you brush up on your matplotlib skills! [Click here for more information on matplotlib.] (https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/notes/python/packages/matplotlib.md)
